# **App Name**: RoadWise

## Core Features:

- AI-Powered Hazard Detection: Utilize YOLO AI to detect road hazards like potholes, debris, and unmarked speed breakers from a simulated camera feed.
- Real-Time Alert System: Provide voice alerts to drivers based on detected hazards and proximity, triggered when hazards are detected within a calculated alert distance. LLM tool is used to determine when an alert is most relevant, and which level of alert is needed.
- Interactive Hazard Map: Display detected hazards on an interactive map (OpenStreetMap) with location, severity, and time detected.
- Simulated GPS and Speed Tracking: Show current GPS coordinates and speed (in km/h) on the real-time detection dashboard to simulate a connected driving experience.
- Feature Showcase: Present key features (AI detection, GPS geo-tagging, voice alerts, privacy blur, smart deduplication, predictive analytics) using animated cards or grid layout.
- Edge-Cloud Architecture Simulation: Illustrate the data flow from camera to AI detection to voice alert using a flow diagram to emphasize low-latency and privacy.
- User Interface Simulation: Provide 'Login as Authority' and 'Sign In as Driver' buttons to simulate dashboard access, enhancing the interactive feel of the prototype.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Tech blue (#4A6FA3) to convey trust, intelligence, and technological advancement.
- Background color: Light blue-gray (#E0E5EC) to maintain a clean and modern appearance, providing a neutral backdrop for the interface.
- Accent color: Lime green (#BCE29E) to draw attention to alerts and interactive elements, conveying safety and action.
- Headline font: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for a computerized, techy, scientific feel, to create a contemporary design.
- Body font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for a modern, machined, objective, neutral look that supports readability. 
- Utilize car icons, map icons, hazard icons (pothole, speed breaker, debris), and voice symbols to represent functionality.
- Incorporate small animations, such as a moving car, pulsing alerts, and blinking map markers, to enhance user engagement and provide feedback.
